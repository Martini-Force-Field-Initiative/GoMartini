# create_goVirt

`create_goVirt` powers the deployment of the new virtual-site implementation of GōMartini which can be combined with the latest iteration of the [Martini](http://cgmartini.nl/) model, [Martini 3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01098-3). 

## Installation (WIP)

`create_goVirt` requires python 3.6 or greater. It is distributed via PyPi, and can be installed using the pip command:
``````
pip install XXXXXXX (STILL NEED TO PACKAGE IT.)
``````

This installs the last released version. You can update an existing installation by running `pip install -U XXXXXXX`. In some cases you may want to experiment with running the latest development version. You can install this version with the following command:
``````
pip install git+https://github.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
``````

Note that development versions, may contain bugs that cause it to produce incorrect topologies. Check the produced output carefully!

The behavior of the pip command can vary depending of the specificity of your python installation. See the documentation on installing a python package to learn more.

## Basic usage

### 1. Martinize
To set up a GōMartini model, the atomistic protein structure must first be martinized using [martinize2](https://github.com/marrink-lab/vermouth-martinize). 

The `--govs-include` martinize2 flag prepares a `protein.itp` with the `include` statements required to incorporate the Gō-like model generated by `create_goVirt`. A second flag (`--govs-moltype`) specifies the molecule name. This name is used as prefix for the files containing the Gō-like model (which will be generated in a following step by `create_goVirt`). 

A typical Martinize command for generating a Gō-ready `protein.itp` may look something like this:

````
martinize2 -f pdb.pdb -x cg.pdb -o topol.top -ff martini3001 -dssp dssp -scfix -govs-include -govs-moltype molecule_0 
````


### 2. Create the contact map

Gō-like contacts are defined by two criteria: a residue overlap criterion, and a [restricted chemical structural units (rCSU) criterion](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00986). This rCSU criterion is dependent on a contact map, which will bre required in the following step. 

This rCSU contact map can be obtained from a [webserver](http://info.ifpan.edu.pl/~rcsu/rcsu/index.html) by inputing your original atomistic `protein.pdb` file and using the default values for the `radii` and `Fibonacci number`. Note that the requirements for the `pdb` file uploaded to the webserver are quite strict. Thus do carefully check if your contact map is meaningful before using it in the next step. In particular, the table listing the “Residue residue contacts” will be used.

Alternatively, a locally executable version of the webserver is also available. The source files for the `contact_map` executable can be found at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3817447.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3817447). If you use the locally executable version of the contact map, please cite:

### 3. create_goVirt

>The `cg.pdb` structure and `.itp` obtained from martinize2 (see Step 1) are required for the next step, together with a contact map (`.map`) of the atomistic protein structure (see Step 2). 

`create_goVirt` generates all additional files required for GōMartini. 

#### 3.1. Creating a basic Gō-like model

##### 3.1.1. Input
In its most basic application, `create_goVirt` requires the CG protein structure of the protein in pdb format (`-s`), the number of CG beads in the protein excluding virtual Gō beads (`--Natoms`), the number of missing residues in the atomistic structure (`--missres`), as well as the contact map file (`-f`). 

The prefix of the generated files can be specified (`--moltype`) to e.g. distinguish different protein chains which are not connected by Gō-like bonds. This prefix must match the one assigned in Step 1 on martinize2 with the flag `--govs-moltype`.

In addition, the dissociation energy of the Lennard-Jones potentials (`--go_eps`) as well as the lower (`--cutoff_short`) and upper (`--cutoff_long`) distance cutoffs for two connected backbone beads can also be specified.

The following settings are strongly recommended:
``````
--go_eps 9.414 kJ/mol
--cutoff_short 0.3 nm
--cutoff_long 1.1 nm
``````


#### 3.2. Adding a water bias to the Gō-like model



If you specify the same molecule name for create_goVirt.py, and if the files containing the Gō-like model are in the same directory, you do not have to change anything in the generated protein.itp!



#### 3.3. Adding water bias without applying a  Gō-like model
